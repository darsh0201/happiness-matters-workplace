# happiness matters at workplace

This dataset (as far as I understand) provides information retrieved through an informative system called HappyForce https://www.myhappyforce.com/en/  aimed at collecting data about employees satisfaction and happyness. 

By means of an app  employees have been asked to answer a question?
**"How happy ar you today at work?**
The following answers were possible:
- 4 Great
- 3 Good
- 2 So So
- 1 Pretty Bad

Whenever they want they can post this feeback about their happiness and leave a comment. The can also like or dislike comments. Plesae visit the related site for complete and correct information.

According to [1]Â the data spans 2.5 years and 4,356 employees of 34 companies  based  in  Barcelona.

This dataset is amazingly interesting because it provides different perspectives on an elusive phaenomenon like employees happines. It also provides different data challenges like:
- time series like the trend of happiness self perception in time or the thrend of posted comments, etc.;
- networks analysis of social interactions (i.e. likes, dislikes, etc.);
- clustering;
- prediction (i.e. predict whether an employee will evntually leave the company at the end of the observation time)
